    "Boggle is a game played on a 4 x 4 grid of letters. The goal is to find as many words as possible that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent letters in the grid, using each cell at most once. Given a game board and a dictionary of valid words, implement a Boggle solver.\n",

    "This is essentially a modified depth-first search on a graph whose vertices are the letters, and whose edges are links between adjacent letters. Searching a neighbor involves adding the new letter to the current word and checking to see if the word is in our dictionary. The only difference is that even when we form a word, we should continue searching; in the grid above, for example, we might want both cat and cats."

One improvement, then, would be to only start searching from letters that also begin words in our dictionary. Still, we would have the same search explosion once we reach the second letter.\n",
