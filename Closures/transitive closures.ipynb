    "# Finding Transitive Closures\n",
    "\n",
    "The transitive closure of a graph is a measure of which vertices are reachable from other vertices. It can be represented as a matrix M, where M[i][j] == 1 if there is a path between vertices i and j, and otherwise 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we are given the following graph in adjacency list form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "graph = [\n",
    "    [0, 1, 3],\n",
    "    [1, 2],\n",
    "    [2],\n",
    "    [3]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The transitive closure of this graph would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1, 1, 1, 1]\n",
    "[0, 1, 1, 0]\n",
    "[0, 0, 1, 0]\n",
    "[0, 0, 0, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Given a graph, find its transitive closure..\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: \n",
    "> Traditionally Floyd-Warshall is used for finding the shortest path between all vertices in a weighted graph. It works in the following way: for any pair of nodes (i, j), check to see if there is an intermediate vertex k such that the cost of getting from i to k to j is less than the current cost of getting from i to j. This is generalized by examining each possible choice of k, and updating every (i, j) cost that can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We're not concerned with costs but whether it's possible to get from i to j. \n",
    "- So create a matrix called reachable and fill it with 0's, except for connections given in the adjacency matrix that we're provided. "
